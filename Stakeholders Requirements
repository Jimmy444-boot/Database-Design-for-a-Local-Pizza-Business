📦 Helena Pizzeria – Stakeholder Database Requirements & Design Documentation
📌 Project Overview
This document outlines the database requirements for Helena Pizzeria, based on discussions with key stakeholders. The goal is to build a scalable and relational database system to efficiently manage orders, customers, items, ingredients, staff, and delivery processes.

🧑‍💼 Stakeholder Requirements
1. Order Management
Stakeholders need real-time tracking of customer orders.

Orders must include: items ordered, quantity, delivery or pickup option, and delivery address (if applicable).

Ability to associate each order with a specific customer and timestamp.

2. Customer Information
The business must capture customer names and associate them with orders.

Support for storing repeat customer data (for loyalty or marketing purposes).

3. Item and Menu Management
Items must be linked to recipes and inventory for cost tracking.

Each item needs size, category, and pricing details.

SKU mapping must be supported for unique menu identification.

4. Inventory & Ingredients
Track each ingredient's quantity, unit price, and measurement.

Ensure recipes deduct from inventory in real time.

Record which ingredients are required per recipe and how much.

5. Staff and Scheduling (Rota)
Shift scheduling is essential to ensure enough staff coverage.

Staff members must be associated with specific shifts on specific dates.

Hourly rates and roles must be trackable for payroll and planning.

6. Delivery Tracking
Each order that requires delivery must include a valid delivery address.

Multiple address fields allow flexibility (apartment numbers, etc.)

Integration with delivery ZIP codes and cities for logistics planning.

🧠 Thought Process Behind Database Design
This database design follows relational database best practices, ensuring data integrity, normalization, and referential integrity. Here's a breakdown of the design considerations:

✅ Normalization
The database follows 3rd Normal Form (3NF) principles:

Reduces redundancy (e.g., addresses stored separately, linked by address_id).

Uses foreign keys to maintain clear relationships between tables.

Allows modular expansion (e.g., if we want to add delivery fees or discounts later).

🔗 Foreign Key Usage
Every order references the correct item, customer, and address.

recipe acts as a junction table between item and ingredient, allowing many-to-many relationships.

rota tracks staff scheduling, linked to both staff and orders.

⛓️ Data Integrity
Data types have been chosen carefully (e.g., boolean for delivery, decimal for prices).

Primary and foreign keys enforce consistency and prevent orphan records.

🔄 Scalability
Easily extendable with additional features like payment tracking, delivery status, or loyalty rewards.

Structured to support business intelligence and reporting needs.
